// I didn't get to my stretch goals yet but these are my next steps:

// ========= BANNER ========= //
// Put background pattern in a carousel but have the name & tagline remain fixed with a higher z-index.
// +++ STRETCH GOAL DELUX: Have a click & drag tab at the bottom of the banner, when user drags the tab the background pattern changes but the name & tagline remain fixed with a higher z-index. 

// ========= NAV ========= //
// Make ^ in Nav only appear when header is out of view.
// Hamburger Nav.

// ========= WORKS IN PROGRESS ========= //
// Display these projects in a carousel.
// Display images only and show project info on hover.

// ========= CONTACT ========= //
// Create another carousel or pop-up-book style transition into another collage of me but as a small child.
// Once my domain has transferred over from Wix to Hover, I will set up a contact form linked to hello@beatriceduncan.com.
